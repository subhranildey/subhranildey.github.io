So the behaviours of consumers are different according to they are in China or not. This Oligopoly 
constraints the chinese inhabitants to use the digital chinese services, or to be in the illegality 
by using a Virtual **Network Private** (VPN) to use other blacklisted services. So chinese government 
controls the chinese digital market with its own private company. 

In China we have a gang of four with **Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, Xiaomi** (BATX), and for the rest of

enter in the digital consummation. On the **software side**, your digital experience consists of 
searching with engine of Google or Baidu, **buying** with e-commerce platform of Amazon or Alibaba, and 
**communicating** with social network of Tencent or Facebook, that have respectively instant messaging 
Messenger & Whatsapp and WeChat. For **spending money online**, WeChat is in competition with Apple Pay

The **cloud computing and hosting** is managed by Google Cloud Platform, or Amazon Web Service (AWS), 
and in China there is Alibaba Cloud, also known as Aliyun.

opportunities. Of course a lot of companies are forgotten in the artificial classification BATX
